  <h2>Aboout Me!</h2>
  <p>
    I have a confession to makeâ€Šâ€”â€ŠIâ€™m not a rock star programmer. Nor I am a hacker. I donâ€™t know what everyone thinks about me. Nobody has ever called me a wizard. Still, I take pride in the fact that Iâ€™m a good, solid programmer. One who works hard at his craft and really enjoys it, even without the fancy labels.. <br>
I am self taught developer and make apps, libraries/APIs under Developer Name: ganeshkavhar <br>
I spend a lot of my development time contributing to open-source projects. <br>
Most of it started by myself which can be found from my GitHub profile.
Other than this, I love Music ðŸŽµ..
